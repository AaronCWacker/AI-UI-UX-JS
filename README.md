# AI-UI-UX-JS
AI Pair Programming Examples of Top 100 JS and HTML Techniques for Simulators and Advanced Interactive 3D Spaces

## How to use this repo:
1. Clone me.  Inspect the Gitactions and Index files.  Gitactions does auto web deploy to Git Pages with domain and SSL cert.
2. Make it your own - try small fast confirmation changes (1-10 seconds) by:
   - create a new git file called Your_Fun_To_Write_App.html
   - check it in
   - try to find the URL and share it with a friend.
3. index.html is special - edit that one in grok, gpt, gemini or claude, all are great outputs and fun that they are so different.  Mashups of multiple unlock new capabilities since some are going to be better at book smart retrieval due to corpus so are all uniquely skilled based on input datasets.
4. Create new apps and githubio it.  This means making a URL you can link to based on name of file and then automatically rebuild outputs ready to go on the interwebs.

# State of AI Demonstration

State of AI Architecture in 2025 has become agentic, multimodal, persona based, multimodal, and integrating ideas and creation of apps as output assets in record time.

In 2025 I had by far the largest AI development speed up when the frontier AI's (Grok, Gemini, GPT, and Claude).  This demonstration will show unique features from each that represented new intelligence driven strengths and opportunities.

The very scientific definition of AI is changing.  On the forefront AI & Biology are coming together understanding minds and intelligence at cell and network levels (Michael Levin).  This is the biggest incursion into Health and Medical intelligence as its solving some cornerstone problems for Cybertech integration at agentic levels with goals.

This covers a bit of each:

1. 
An initial study of Starships inspired by the hard cover books for STAR TREK with useful scientific hypothetical details.  A crucial skill is star man or steel man any argument without regard if you believe it.  With scifi you can entertain yourself by doing a mix of the real input data and hypothetical experiment to see what its good at and then move that towards your opportunities.

<img width="1068" height="1618" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbb03506-0f61-4cbd-aaf0-d2a704df6caf" />


3. This takes prompting to a new level since you can add and change styles and content, <img width="1068" height="1618" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee597e01-b83a-4342-821e-d550a5121118" />

4. Now with a video the base of the tower is shown per language spec in a tiny prompt (with misspellings and data gaps yet hopeful!).

<img width="1068" height="1618" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/673c7af7-506e-4635-98f9-0a1b2665006f" />

# 1. Exercise - AI Assisted Architecture from a Drawing

![2025-12-07_09-01-34](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e79ccc71-07e8-41db-b70d-b82d444ce0ad)

I used Logitech app called Logi Capture to access a set of cameras.  This app allows you to record video from screens, cameras and intercombinations so is quite useful to capture.  Second place this year for video input is ClipChamp which is easily available with a link.

![2025-12-07_09-01-34](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e047336d-07c1-4c45-a7fa-f1c9744fee26)

The Gemini AI was able to take my input and generate a line drawing with architecture instructions and do a fairly good job at standardizing the line drawings:  ![Aaron Wacker - 4704 Cavan Road Property - Architecture Study](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93a380f8-1a8f-4c89-b515-b3a84810950e)

It did surprisingly well in sorting out the probables.  

# 2. Exercise - Understanding Re-Engineering in 2025 or Invention By Knowledge Behavioral Agentic Communications

What I understand on limitations or constraints within a space is curiosity.

Curiosity leads to asking the most insightful answered question that I can that aligns with my predictivtion about other agents who know more but also what question to ask and how to reposition our direction and goal in the face of new knowledge which defines our autonomy from the connected network we may freely express without interrupting the base requirements of holding a state that can be replicated by code and data design.

Addition of better design around tower and gazebo.

# Cheapest & Easiest Domain Registrars for GitHub Pages

## Overview
Focusing on minimal time/expense waste for procuring a domain and configuring DNS (A/CNAME records) for a GitHub Pages site already launched. Recommendations prioritize registrars with low-cost .com domains (under $12/year), simple purchase process, and fast DNS setup for GitHub Pages (mapping to IPs like 185.199.108.153 and CNAME to `username.github.io`). Scalability ensures easy addition of domains without cost spikes or complexity. Top picks: **Porkbun**, **Cloudflare Registrar**, and **Namecheap**. Free subdomains (e.g., .tk) skipped due to unreliability; pricier registrars (e.g., GoDaddy) excluded for renewal hikes.

## Buckeyball Rating System
- Inspired by fullerene's efficient structure for minimal waste/maximal efficiency.
- 🌑 = 1 (Black hole: Total waste)
- 🌒 = 2 (Crescent: Barely usable)
- 🌓 = 3 (Half: Average, some drag)
- 🌔 = 4 (Gibbous: Strong, minor tweaks)
- 🌕 = 5 (Full: Perfect efficiency—fast, cheap, scalable)

## Registrar Evaluations

### 1. Porkbun
Cheapest first-year promos, simplest UI, no upsells. Ideal for fast setup and scaling multiple GitHub Pages sites.

| Factor | Rating | Why It Fits (Time/Expense Minimization) |
|--------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| Upfront Cost (.com first year) | 🌕 (5) | ~$5-7 with promos; free privacy/SSL—no extras needed. |
| Renewal Cost (Scalability) | 🌕 (5) | $10-11/year; no hikes, easy bulk buys. |
| Ease of Purchase | 🌕 (5) | 2-click checkout; <2 min, no forced bundles. |
| DNS Setup Speed for GitHub Pages | 🌕 (5) | Intuitive panel; 3-5 min for A/CNAME; 5-30 min propagation. |
| Overall Simplicity (No Waste) | 🌕 (5) | Minimalist dashboard; no ads; scales fast. |
| Support for Issues | 🌔 (4) | Email/chat (24h); US-based, DNS help rare. |
| **Total Buckeyballs** | **29/30** | Fastest/cheapest; zero friction for mapping. |

### 2. Cloudflare Registrar
Wholesale pricing, instant DNS, free CDN/SSL. Best for scaling to 100+ domains, but minor account setup overhead.

| Factor | Rating | Why It Fits (Time/Expense Minimization) |
|--------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| Upfront Cost (.com first year) | 🌕 (5) | $8-10 wholesale; free privacy/SSL. |
| Renewal Cost (Scalability) | 🌕 (5) | $8-10/year locked; bulk discounts. |
| Ease of Purchase | 🌔 (4) | Quick buy, but needs Cloudflare account (1 min). |
| DNS Setup Speed for GitHub Pages | 🌕 (5) | Top-tier panel; auto-suggests GitHub IPs; <5 min, instant propagation. |
| Overall Simplicity (No Waste) | 🌔 (4) | Unified DNS/security; slight learning curve. |
| Support for Issues | 🌔 (4) | Docs/forums great; chat for paid, free tier enough. |
| **Total Buckeyballs** | **28/30** | Scalable, performant; tiny setup cost. |

### 3. Namecheap
Beginner-friendly with promos, but slightly cluttered. Reliable GitHub integration, good for small-scale projects.

| Factor | Rating | Why It Fits (Time/Expense Minimization) |
|--------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| Upfront Cost (.com first year) | 🌔 (4) | $6-9 with coupons; free privacy, watch email pitches. |
| Renewal Cost (Scalability) | 🌔 (4) | $13-15/year; higher than rivals, easy bulk. |
| Ease of Purchase | 🌔 (4) | Fast search, but upsell popups (~1 min). |
| DNS Setup Speed for GitHub Pages | 🌕 (5) | BasicDNS panel; 5-min setup; dedicated guide. |
| Overall Simplicity (No Waste) | 🌔 (4) | Clean, but ads/UI add ~2 min vs. Porkbun. |
| Support for Issues | 🌕 (5) | 24/7 chat; quick DNS fixes, newbie-friendly. |
| **Total Buckeyballs** | **26/30** | Solid one-off, but renewals/UI less efficient. |

## Recommended Action: Porkbun Setup
1. Visit `porkbun.com`, search domain (e.g., `yourapp.com`).
2. Buy (~$7, free privacy).
3. Dashboard > DNS: Add 4x A records (@ → 185.199.108.153, etc.), 1x CNAME (www → `yourusername.github.io`).
4. GitHub repo > Settings > Pages > Custom domain: Enter domain, enforce HTTPS.
5. Done in ~10 min; scales by repeating.

**Note**: For 10+ domains, Cloudflare’s pricing/DNS edge out slightly. Specific TLD or promo needs? Let me know!
