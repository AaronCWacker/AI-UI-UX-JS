# Cheapest & Easiest Domain Registrars for GitHub Pages

## Overview
Focusing on minimal time/expense waste for procuring a domain and configuring DNS (A/CNAME records) for a GitHub Pages site already launched. Recommendations prioritize registrars with low-cost .com domains (under $12/year), simple purchase process, and fast DNS setup for GitHub Pages (mapping to IPs like 185.199.108.153 and CNAME to `username.github.io`). Scalability ensures easy addition of domains without cost spikes or complexity. Top picks: **Porkbun**, **Cloudflare Registrar**, and **Namecheap**. Free subdomains (e.g., .tk) skipped due to unreliability; pricier registrars (e.g., GoDaddy) excluded for renewal hikes.

## Recommended Action: Porkbun Setup
1. Visit `porkbun.com`, search domain (e.g., `yourapp.com`).
2. Buy (~$7, free privacy).
3. Dashboard > DNS: Add 4x A records (@ → 185.199.108.153, etc.), 1x CNAME (www → `yourusername.github.io`).
4. GitHub repo > Settings > Pages > Custom domain: Enter domain, enforce HTTPS.
5. Done in ~10 min; scales by repeating.

**Note**: For 10+ domains, Cloudflare’s pricing/DNS edge out slightly. Specific TLD or promo needs? Let me know!
