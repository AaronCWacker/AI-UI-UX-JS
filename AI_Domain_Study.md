# Cheapest & Easiest Domain Registrars for GitHub Pages

## Overview
Focusing on minimal time/expense waste for procuring a domain and configuring DNS (A/CNAME records) for a GitHub Pages site already launched. Recommendations prioritize registrars with low-cost .com domains (under $12/year), simple purchase process, and fast DNS setup for GitHub Pages (mapping to IPs like 185.199.108.153 and CNAME to `username.github.io`). Scalability ensures easy addition of domains without cost spikes or complexity. Top picks: **Porkbun**, **Cloudflare Registrar**, and **Namecheap**. Free subdomains (e.g., .tk) skipped due to unreliability; pricier registrars (e.g., GoDaddy) excluded for renewal hikes.
